---

This assignment includes a shiny app development for Option A: BC Liquor (http://127.0.0.1:4384).There are three new features that are different from the “basic” version. Including i) Show the number of results found whenever the filters change. For example, in the BC Liquor app, when searching for Italian wines $10 - $30, the app would show the text “We have found 2917 results for you”, ii) Add an image to the UI about the BC Liquor stores, and iii) let the user decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.
